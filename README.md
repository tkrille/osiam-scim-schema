The scim schema provides a User and a Group Object which are used to echange data with the [OSIAM Server](https://github.com/osiam/server)

It is also used by the [OSIAM connector4java](https://github.com/osiam/connector4java) which gives you a easy way to interact with OSIAM if you are using Java.
